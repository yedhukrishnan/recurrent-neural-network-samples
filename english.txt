It
was
with
considerable
reluctance
that
I
abandoned
in
favour
of
the
present
undertaking
what
had
long
been
a
favourite
project
that
of
a
new
edition
of
Sheltons
Don
Quixote
which
has
now
become
a
somewhat
scarce
book
There
are
someand
I
confess
myself
to
be
onefor
whom
Sheltons
racy
old
version
with
all
its
defects
has
a
charm
that
no
modern
translation
however
skilful
or
correct
could
possess
Shelton
had
the
inestimable
advantage
of
belonging
to
the
same
generation
as
Cervantes
Don
Quixote
had
to
him
a
vitality
that
only
a
contemporary
could
feel
it
cost
him
no
dramatic
effort
to
see
things
as
Cervantes
saw
them
there
is
no
anachronism
in
his
language
he
put
the
Spanish
of
Cervantes
into
the
English
of
Shakespeare
Shakespeare
himself
most
likely
knew
the
book
he
may
have
carried
it
home
with
him
in
his
saddlebags
to
Stratford
on
one
of
his
last
journeys
and
under
the
mulberry
tree
at
New
Place
joined
hands
with
a
kindred
genius
in
its
pages

But
it
was
soon
made
plain
to
me
that
to
hope
for
even
a
moderate
popularity
for
Shelton
was
vain
His
fine
old
crusted
English
would
no
doubt
be
relished
by
a
minority
but
it
would
be
only
by
a
minority
His
warmest
admirers
must
admit
that
he
is
not
a
satisfactory
representative
of
Cervantes
His
translation
of
the
First
Part
was
very
hastily
made
and
was
never
revised
by
him
It
has
all
the
freshness
and
vigour
but
also
a
full
measure
of
the
faults
of
a
hasty
production
It
is
often
very
literalbarbarously
literal
frequentlybut
just
as
often
very
loose
He
had
evidently
a
good
colloquial
knowledge
of
Spanish
but
apparently
not
much
more
It
never
seems
to
occur
to
him
that
the
same
translation
of
a
word
will
not
suit
in
every
case

It
is
often
said
that
we
have
no
satisfactory
translation
of
Don
Quixote
To
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
original
it
savours
of
truism
or
platitude
to
say
so
for
in
truth
there
can
be
no
thoroughly
satisfactory
translation
of
Don
Quixote
into
English
or
any
other
language
It
is
not
that
the
Spanish
idioms
are
so
utterly
unmanageable
or
that
the
untranslatable
words
numerous
enough
no
doubt
are
so
superabundant
but
rather
that
the
sententious
terseness
to
which
the
humour
of
the
book
owes
its
flavour
is
peculiar
to
Spanish
and
can
at
best
be
only
distantly
imitated
in
any
other
tongue

The
history
of
our
English
translations
of
Don
Quixote
is
instructive
Sheltons
the
first
in
any
language
was
made
apparently
about

but
not
published
till

This
of
course
was
only
the
First
Part
It
has
been
asserted
that
the
Second
published
in

is
not
the
work
of
Shelton
but
there
is
nothing
to
support
the
assertion
save
the
fact
that
it
has
less
spirit
less
of
what
we
generally
understand
by
go
about
it
than
the
first
which
would
be
only
natural
if
the
first
were
the
work
of
a
young
man
writing
currente
calamo
and
the
second
that
of
a
middleaged
man
writing
for
a
bookseller
On
the
other
hand
it
is
closer
and
more
literal
the
style
is
the
same
the
very
same
translations
or
mistranslations
occur
in
it
and
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
a
new
translator
would
by
suppressing
his
name
have
allowed
Shelton
to
carry
off
the
credit

In

John
Phillips
Miltons
nephew
produced
a
Don
Quixote
made
English
he
says
according
to
the
humour
of
our
modern
language
His
Quixote
is
not
so
much
a
translation
as
a
travesty
and
a
travesty
that
for
coarseness
vulgarity
and
buffoonery
is
almost
unexampled
even
in
the
literature
of
that
day

Ned
Wards
Life
and
Notable
Adventures
of
Don
Quixote
merrily
translated
into
Hudibrastic
Verse
can
scarcely
be
reckoned
a
translation
but
it
serves
to
show
the
light
in
which
Don
Quixote
was
regarded
at
the
time

A
further
illustration
may
be
found
in
the
version
published
in

by
Peter
Motteux
who
had
then
recently
combined
teadealing
with
literature
It
is
described
as
translated
from
the
original
by
several
hands
but
if
so
all
Spanish
flavour
has
entirely
evaporated
under
the
manipulation
of
the
several
hands
The
flavour
that
it
has
on
the
other
hand
is
distinctly
Francocockney
Anyone
who
compares
it
carefully
with
the
original
will
have
little
doubt
that
it
is
a
concoction
from
Shelton
and
the
French
of
Filleau
de
Saint
Martin
eked
out
by
borrowings
from
Phillips
whose
mode
of
treatment
it
adopts
It
is
to
be
sure
more
decent
and
decorous
but
it
treats
Don
Quixote
in
the
same
fashion
as
a
comic
book
that
cannot
be
made
too
comic

To
attempt
to
improve
the
humour
of
Don
Quixote
by
an
infusion
of
cockney
flippancy
and
facetiousness
as
Motteuxs
operators
did
is
not
merely
an
impertinence
like
larding
a
sirloin
of
prize
beef
but
an
absolute
falsification
of
the
spirit
of
the
book
and
it
is
a
proof
of
the
uncritical
way
in
which
Don
Quixote
is
generally
read
that
this
worse
than
worthless
translationworthless
as
failing
to
represent
worse
than
worthless
as
misrepresentingshould
have
been
favoured
as
it
has
been

It
had
the
effect
however
of
bringing
out
a
translation
undertaken
and
executed
in
a
very
different
spirit
that
of
Charles
Jervas
the
portrait
painter
and
friend
of
Pope
Swift
Arbuthnot
and
Gay
Jervas
has
been
allowed
little
credit
for
his
work
indeed
it
may
be
said
none
for
it
is
known
to
the
world
in
general
as
Jarviss
It
was
not
published
until
after
his
death
and
the
printers
gave
the
name
according
to
the
current
pronunciation
of
the
day
It
has
been
the
most
freely
used
and
the
most
freely
abused
of
all
the
translations
It
has
seen
far
more
editions
than
any
other
it
is
admitted
on
all
hands
to
be
by
far
the
most
faithful
and
yet
nobody
seems
to
have
a
good
word
to
say
for
it
or
for
its
author
Jervas
no
doubt
prejudiced
readers
against
himself
in
his
preface
where
among
many
true
words
about
Shelton
Stevens
and
Motteux
he
rashly
and
unjustly
charges
Shelton
with
having
translated
not
from
the
Spanish
but
from
the
Italian
version
of
Franciosini
which
did
not
appear
until
ten
years
after
Sheltons
first
volume
A
suspicion
of
incompetence
too
seems
to
have
attached
to
him
because
he
was
by
profession
a
painter
and
a
mediocre
onehough
he
has
given
us
the
best
portrait
we
have
of
Swift
and
this
may
have
been
strengthened
by
Popes
remark
that
he
translated
Don
Quixote
without
understanding
Spanish
He
has
been
also
charged
with
borrowing
from
Shelton
whom
he
disparaged
It
is
true
that
in
a
few
difficult
or
obscure
passages
he
has
followed
Shelton
and
gone
astray
with
him
but
for
one
case
of
this
sort
there
are
fifty
where
he
is
right
and
Shelton
wrong
As
for
Popes
dictum
anyone
who
examines
Jervass
version
carefully
side
by
side
with
the
original
will
see
that
he
was
a
sound
Spanish
scholar
incomparably
a
better
one
than
Shelton
except
perhaps
in
mere
colloquial
Spanish
He
was
in
fact
an
honest
faithful
and
painstaking
translator
and
he
has
left
a
version
which
whatever
its
shortcomings
may
be
is
singularly
free
from
errors
and
mistranslations

The
charge
against
it
is
that
it
is
stiff
drywooden
in
a
wordand
no
one
can
deny
that
there
is
a
foundation
for
it
But
it
may
be
pleaded
for
Jervas
that
a
good
deal
of
this
rigidity
is
due
to
his
abhorrence
of
the
light
flippant
jocose
style
of
his
predecessors
He
was
one
of
the
few
very
few
translators
that
have
shown
any
apprehension
of
the
unsmiling
gravity
which
is
the
essence
of
Quixotic
humour
it
seemed
to
him
a
crime
to
bring
Cervantes
forward
smirking
and
grinning
at
his
own
good
things
and
to
this
may
be
attributed
in
a
great
measure
the
ascetic
abstinence
from
everything
savouring
of
liveliness
which
is
the
characteristic
of
his
translation
In
most
modern
editions
it
should
be
observed
his
style
has
been
smoothed
and
smartened
but
without
any
reference
to
the
original
Spanish
so
that
if
he
has
been
made
to
read
more
agreeably
he
has
also
been
robbed
of
his
chief
merit
of
fidelity

Smolletts
version
published
in

may
be
almost
counted
as
one
of
these
At
any
rate
it
is
plain
that
in
its
construction
Jervass
translation
was
very
freely
drawn
upon
and
very
little
or
probably
no
heed
given
to
the
original
Spanish

The
later
translations
may
be
dismissed
in
a
few
words
George
Kellys
which
appeared
in

printed
for
the
Translator
was
an
impudent
imposture
being
nothing
more
than
Motteuxs
version
with
a
few
of
the
words
here
and
there
artfully
transposed
Charles
Wilmots
was
only
an
abridgment
like
Florians
but
not
so
skilfully
executed
and
the
version
published
by
Miss
Smirke
in

to
accompany
her
brothers
plates
was
merely
a
patchwork
production
made
out
of
former
translations
On
the
latest
Mr
A
J
Duffields
it
would
be
in
every
sense
of
the
word
impertinent
in
me
to
offer
an
opinion
here
I
had
not
even
seen
it
when
the
present
undertaking
was
proposed
to
me
and
since
then
I
may
say
vidi
tantum
having
for
obvious
reasons
resisted
the
temptation
which
Mr
Duffields
reputation
and
comely
volumes
hold
out
to
every
lover
of
Cervantes

From
the
foregoing
history
of
our
translations
of
Don
Quixote
it
will
be
seen
that
there
are
a
good
many
people
who
provided
they
get
the
mere
narrative
with
its
full
complement
of
facts
incidents
and
adventures
served
up
to
them
in
a
form
that
amuses
them
care
very
little
whether
that
form
is
the
one
in
which
Cervantes
originally
shaped
his
ideas
On
the
other
hand
it
is
clear
that
there
are
many
who
desire
to
have
not
merely
the
story
he
tells
but
the
story
as
he
tells
it
so
far
at
least
as
differences
of
idiom
and
circumstances
permit
and
who
will
give
a
preference
to
the
conscientious
translator
even
though
he
may
have
acquitted
himself
somewhat
awkwardly

But
after
all
there
is
no
real
antagonism
between
the
two
classes
there
is
no
reason
why
what
pleases
the
one
should
not
please
the
other
or
why
a
translator
who
makes
it
his
aim
to
treat
Don
Quixote
with
the
respect
due
to
a
great
classic
should
not
be
as
acceptable
even
to
the
careless
reader
as
the
one
who
treats
it
as
a
famous
old
jestbook
It
is
not
a
question
of
caviare
to
the
general
or
if
it
is
the
fault
rests
with
him
who
makes
so
The
method
by
which
Cervantes
won
the
ear
of
the
Spanish
people
ought
mutatis
mutandis
to
be
equally
effective
with
the
great
majority
of
English
readers
At
any
rate
even
if
there
are
readers
to
whom
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
fidelity
to
the
method
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
translators
duty
as
fidelity
to
the
matter
If
he
can
please
all
parties
so
much
the
better
but
his
first
duty
is
to
those
who
look
to
him
for
as
faithful
a
representation
of
his
author
as
it
is
in
his
power
to
give
them
faithful
to
the
letter
so
long
as
fidelity
is
practicable
faithful
to
the
spirit
so
far
as
he
can
make
it

My
purpose
here
is
not
to
dogmatise
on
the
rules
of
translation
but
to
indicate
those
I
have
followed
or
at
least
tried
to
the
best
of
my
ability
to
follow
in
the
present
instance
One
which
it
seems
to
me
cannot
be
too
rigidly
followed
in
translating
Don
Quixote
is
to
avoid
everything
that
savours
of
affectation
The
book
itself
is
indeed
in
one
sense
a
protest
against
it
and
no
man
abhorred
it
more
than
Cervantes
For
this
reason
I
think
any
temptation
to
use
antiquated
or
obsolete
language
should
be
resisted
It
is
after
all
an
affectation
and
one
for
which
there
is
no
warrant
or
excuse
Spanish
has
probably
undergone
less
change
since
the
seventeenth
century
than
any
language
in
Europe
and
by
far
the
greater
and
certainly
the
best
part
of
Don
Quixote
differs
but
little
in
language
from
the
colloquial
Spanish
of
the
present
day
Except
in
the
tales
and
Don
Quixotes
speeches
the
translator
who
uses
the
simplest
and
plainest
everyday
language
will
almost
always
be
the
one
who
approaches
nearest
to
the
original

Seeing
that
the
story
of
Don
Quixote
and
all
its
characters
and
incidents
have
now
been
for
more
than
two
centuries
and
a
half
familiar
as
household
words
in
English
mouths
it
seems
to
me
that
the
old
familiar
names
and
phrases
should
not
be
changed
without
good
reason
Of
course
a
translator
who
holds
that
Don
Quixote
should
receive
the
treatment
a
great
classic
deserves
will
feel
himself
bound
by
the
injunction
laid
upon
the
Morisco
in
Chap
IX
not
to
omit
or
add
anything
